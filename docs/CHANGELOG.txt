Summarizing r24-r26 in trunk:

- Support for many new data types, like sparse matrices, struct and cell
arrays, booleans, etc.

- The user now sees a high-level API of the MATLAB session which exposes
the matlab name space, and allows functions to be called as if one was
in matlab (argument translation is implicit & automagic).  MATLAB
functions expose their MATLAB help in ipython with standard help mechanisms.

In []: m.plot ? 

- Added "rpath" to unix setup.cfg example, so that no LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  declaration is necessary.


2010-04-18? pymatlab 0.1.3
--------------------------

Run now throws exception RuntimeError on erros. A critical bug was fixed
concernings numpys C memory alignment and MATLAB's Fortran memory alignment in
matrices.

2010-04-09 pymatlab 0.1.2
-------------------------

Bugfixes for 32-bit machines. Closed some memory leaks.

2010-02-26 pymatlab 0.1.1
-------------------------

Added the missing MANIFEST.in file to include the docs/ directory. And some
small changes in the README.txt to work with restructured text.

2010-02-25 pymatlab 0.1.0
-------------------------

This first version om pymatlab including lots of potential memory leaks.  The
following features ships with this version:

* running commands in the Matlab command interpretor. 

* Placing double precision matrices with arbitrary dimensions on
  the MATLAB workspace from numpy arrays.

* Retrive double precision matrices from MATLAB workspace to numpy arrays.

* Place string variables on MATLAB workspace.

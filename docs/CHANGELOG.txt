2013-10-24 pymatlab 0.2.3
-------------------------

Bugfix. Confirming the GPLv3 licence.

2013-10-21 pymatlab 0.2.2
-------------------------

Now integers of bitlength 8-64 signed or unsigned, single and double precision
floats, complex numbers (single,double) and logical arrays are supported.

2013-10-15 pymatlab 0.2.1
-------------------------

Added support for int16, int32, int64, float32 and float64 matrices of any
rank. Squeezing of matrices is done automatically. Added a convenience 'session
factory' to create a session and start matlab.

2011-11-01 pymatlab 0.2.0
-------------------------

A ctypes implementation. This makes it easier to run and install because of no
need for compilation.

2010-04-18 pymatlab 0.1.3
--------------------------

Run now throws exception RuntimeError on erros. A critical bug was fixed
concernings numpys C memory alignment and MATLAB's Fortran memory alignment in
matrices.

2010-04-09 pymatlab 0.1.2
-------------------------

Bugfixes for 32-bit machines. Closed some memory leaks.

2010-02-26 pymatlab 0.1.1
-------------------------

Added the missing MANIFEST.in file to include the docs/ directory. And some
small changes in the README.txt to work with restructured text.

2010-02-25 pymatlab 0.1.0
-------------------------

This first version om pymatlab including lots of potential memory leaks.  The
following features ships with this version:

* running commands in the Matlab command interpretor. 

* Placing double precision matrices with arbitrary dimensions on
  the MATLAB workspace from numpy arrays.

* Retrive double precision matrices from MATLAB workspace to numpy arrays.

* Place string variables on MATLAB workspace.
